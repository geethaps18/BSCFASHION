About Us
B.S. Channabasappa & sons, established in 1938, is one of the most trusted brands for clothing in Karnataka.

B.S. Nanjundappa, the founder, started selling clothes, with a strict moral code. He believed that the customer is God, and they have to be given the best. This policy stuck with B.S.C. He named the store after his son B.S. Channabasappa, who also followed his father’s footsteps. The idea was to give customers high quality at the best price. Both of them believed in the importance of ethics and morals in business. As a result, B.S. Channabasappa & sons developed generations of loyal customers. It became a tradition to buy clothes at B.S.C. for weddings; there are generations of marriages shopped at B.S.C. B.S.C. has stores spread across 100,000 square feet. It is one of the biggest stores in Karnataka.

Third Generation
Fourth Generation
B.S.C’s USP
B.C.Umapthy, the son of B.S. Channabasappa, joined the business at a very young age and helped his father and grandfather build the business.

B.C.Chandrashekar, next in line, worked towards the dream of making B.S.C. a household name in Karnataka.

B.C.Shivakumar, the younger of all, joined business and developed men’s clothing. Also, thus, began the introduction of different categories of clothing.

Fourth generation:

B.U.C.Shekar, being the lead in the fourth generation, has been instrumental in the introduction of readymade clothing. He also helped third generations develop other categories of clothing.

B.C.Vivek and B.S.Mrunal are the latest in the fourth generation and do believe in serving customers with high quality clothes in the best possible way. While implementing modern ideas of business, the fourth generation believes in the importance of keeping the framework that predecessors have given.

B.S.C. started expanding its business, and by 2022, it has four branches out of which three are in Davangere.

Wide variety of products under one roof, high quality at best prices.
