About Us
B.S. Channabasappa & sons, established in 1938, is one of the most trusted brands for clothing in Karnataka.

B.S. Nanjundappa, the founder, started selling clothes, with a strict moral code. He believed that the customer is God, and they have to be given the best. This policy stuck with B.S.C. He named the store after his son B.S. Channabasappa, who also followed his father‚Äôs footsteps. The idea was to give customers high quality at the best price. Both of them believed in the importance of ethics and morals in business. As a result, B.S. Channabasappa & sons developed generations of loyal customers. It became a tradition to buy clothes at B.S.C. for weddings; there are generations of marriages shopped at B.S.C. B.S.C. has stores spread across 100,000 square feet. It is one of the biggest stores in Karnataka.
